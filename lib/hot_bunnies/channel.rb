  # ## Channels in RabbitMQ
  #
  # To quote {http://www.rabbitmq.com/resources/specs/amqp0-9-1.pdf AMQP 0.9.1 specification}:
  #
  # AMQP 0.9.1 is a multi-channelled protocol. Channels provide a way to multiplex
  # a heavyweight TCP/IP connection into several light weight connections.
  # This makes the protocol more “firewall friendly” since port usage is predictable.
  # It also means that traffic shaping and other network QoS features can be easily employed.
  # Channels are independent of each other and can perform different functions simultaneously
  # with other channels, the available bandwidth being shared between the concurrent activities.
  #
  #
  # ## Opening Channels
  #
  # Channels can be opened either via `HotBunnies::Session#create_channel` (sufficient in the majority
  # of cases) or by instantiating `HotBunnies::Channel` directly:
  #
  # @example Using {HotBunnies::Session#create_channel}:
  #   conn = HotBunnies.new
  #   conn.start
  #
  #   ch   = conn.create_channel
  #
  # This will automatically allocate a channel id.
  #
  # ## Closing Channels
  #
  # Channels are closed via {HotBunnies::Channel#close}. Channels that get a channel-level exception are
  # closed, too. Closed channels can no longer be used. Attempts to use them will raise
  # {HotBunnies::ChannelAlreadyClosed}.
  #
  # @example
  #
  #   ch  = conn.create_channel
  #   ch.close
  #
  # ## Higher-level API
  #
  # HotBunnies offers two sets of methods on {HotBunnies::Channel}: known as higher-level and lower-level
  # APIs, respectively. Higher-level API mimics {http://rubyamqp.info amqp gem} API where
  # exchanges and queues are objects (instance of {HotBunnies::Exchange} and {HotBunnies::Queue}, respectively).
  # Lower-level API is built around AMQP 0.9.1 methods (commands), where queues and exchanges are
  # passed as strings (à la RabbitMQ Java client, {http://clojurerabbitmq.info Langohr} and Pika).
  #
  # ### Queue Operations In Higher-level API
  #
  # * {HotBunnies::Channel#queue} is used to declare queues. The rest of the API is in {HotBunnies::Queue}.
  #
  #
  # ### Exchange Operations In Higher-level API
  #
  # * {HotBunnies::Channel#topic} declares a topic exchange. The rest of the API is in {HotBunnies::Exchange}.
  # * {HotBunnies::Channel#direct} declares a direct exchange.
  # * {HotBunnies::Channel#fanout} declares a fanout exchange.
  # * {HotBunnies::Channel#headers} declares a headers exchange.
  # * {HotBunnies::Channel#default_exchange}
  # * {HotBunnies::Channel#exchange} is used to declare exchanges with type specified as a symbol or string.
  #
  #
  # ## Channel Qos (Prefetch Level)
  #
  # It is possible to control how many messages at most a consumer will be given (before it acknowledges
  # or rejects previously consumed ones). This setting is per channel and controlled via {HotBunnies::Channel#prefetch}.
  #
  #
  # ## Channel IDs
  #
  # Channels are identified by their ids which are integers. HotBunnies takes care of allocating and
  # releasing them as channels are opened and closed. It is almost never necessary to specify
  # channel ids explicitly.
  #
  # There is a limit on the maximum number of channels per connection, usually 65536. Note
  # that allocating channels is very cheap on both client and server so having tens, hundreds
  # or even thousands of channels is possible.
  #
  # ## Channels and Error Handling
  #
  # Channel-level exceptions are more common than connection-level ones and often indicate
  # issues applications can recover from (such as consuming from or trying to delete
  # a queue that does not exist).
  #
  # With HotBunnies, channel-level exceptions are raised as Ruby exceptions, for example,
  # {HotBunnies::NotFound}, that provide access to the underlying `channel.close` method
  # information.
  #
  # @example Handling 404 NOT_FOUND
  #   begin
  #     ch.queue_delete("queue_that_should_not_exist#{rand}")
  #   rescue HotBunnies::NotFound => e
  #     puts "Channel-level exception! Code: #{e.channel_close.reply_code}, message: #{e.channel_close.reply_text}"
  #   end
  #
  # @example Handling 406 PRECONDITION_FAILED
  #   begin
  #     ch2 = conn.create_channel
  #     q   = "hotbunnies.examples.recovery.q#{rand}"
  #
  #     ch2.queue_declare(q, :durable => false)
  #     ch2.queue_declare(q, :durable => true)
  #   rescue HotBunnies::PreconditionFailed => e
  #     puts "Channel-level exception! Code: #{e.channel_close.reply_code}, message: #{e.channel_close.reply_text}"
  #   ensure
  #     conn.create_channel.queue_delete(q)
